# Python Lab

This repository serves as a consolidated space for my Python practice and projects.  
The initial upload contains notes and exercises from **Angela Yu's Python 100 Days Bootcamp (Day 1–15)**.

## Goals
- Strengthen Python fundamentals (syntax, data types, problem-solving)
- Transition into practical projects:
  - Automation scripts
  - Web crawlers
  - Currency/ETF alert bots
- Maintain consistent commit habits with clear documentation

## Future Work
- Extend to Day 16–100 as needed
- Add standalone repositories for real-world projects (`py-tools`, `ai-utils`, etc.)
- Keep daily coding logs in a separate repo (`project-log`)
